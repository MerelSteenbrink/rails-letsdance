# README

This mini-project in meant to get used to the Rails basics again. In this little app you can say something or ask a question. 

The app will respond with:
- "YES! Let's dance!" if the users said "let's dance.".
- "let's find out... DANCING!" if the user asks a question.
- "OK, but now: Let's dance!" if the person says something.
